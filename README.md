üó∫Ô∏è Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

## Project 1 - Amazon Scraping
The code checks the price for the particular product and sends the email, if the price gets lower then our specified price. We also can add  timer, which will run the code every 5 hour (for example).

## Project 2 - E-commerce Scraping
The website which is used for this project is educational webscraping [website](https://www.webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/tablets). It was created to train scraping knowledge. The code is scraping all the products information (prices, names and links) and storing it in the excel file.
